Training Strategy: One Go vs. Multiple Rounds
Single Extensive Training Run:

Advantages:

All data is incorporated at once, which can be efficient if you have a well-curated, comprehensive dataset.
Suitable if your dataset is relatively homogeneous or if your domain is limited.
Considerations:

Risk of overfitting to a particular style or set of questions.
Might require careful balancing of data to ensure all topics are well-represented.






Multiple Training Rounds (Incremental Fine-Tuning):

Advantages:

Allows you to gradually introduce new topics (e.g., starting with basic FAQs and then adding more specialized product and care details).
Easier to monitor and adjust performance on different aspects of your business.
Can help mitigate catastrophic forgetting by fine-tuning on subsets before merging into a final model.
Considerations:

Requires a disciplined approach to scheduling and might add complexity in tracking which data has been learned.
You may need to periodically evaluate the model to ensure it retains previously learned responses.
